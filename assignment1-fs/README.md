# Assignment 1: Create a webpage

## Task description

### Exercise 1 - HTML and CSS

Create a webpage with the following structure:

- **Menu:** A div for the menu (no functionality required but with menu options)
- **Header:** A div for the header (including a logo)
- **Content Blocks:** At least two content blocks with simple content (text, images)
- **Footer:** A div for the footer

Use CSS Grid to position these elements on the page. Additionally, the page must be responsive, meaning the layout should change based on the browser window's width.

Use IDs and classes on these elements and within each div to enable styling with CSS.

Finally, create the CSS for the webpage. Ensure you use at least the following:

- margin
- border
- padding
- background-color
- background-image
- Experiment with different fonts

### Exercise 2 - JavaScript

Add functionality using JavaScript, included via a separate file. Implement the following features:

1. A button with an associated content block/text that increments a number by 1 for each click.
2. A button with an associated content block/text that toggles the visibility of the content.
3. Create an array with random keywords and display the content as a list on the webpage (using ul & li tags). You can choose whether this is done via a button or when the page loads.

Add corresponding CSS for any buttons added.
