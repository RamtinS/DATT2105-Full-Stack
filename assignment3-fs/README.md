# Assignment 3: Contact form for calculator

## Task description

In this assignment, we're going to enhance the existing
calculator from Assignment 2 by incorporating a user-friendly
contact form for feedback. This form will be on a dedicated 
page, featuring input validation, and it will retain the
state of crucial input variables, such as name and email. 
Additionally, we'll be ensuring the robustness of our 
application by implementing both unit testing with Vitest
and end-to-end testing with Cypress.
